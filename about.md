Skepliden for me is just somewhere to post kind of whatever I want when I want. I'd rather post things here than put them on places like Twitter or Instagram. Those sites are so filled with people so focused on getting likes and making clever captions; like why does it matter?

Skepliden is a place to get away from all of that. A place where I can post what's going on in my head, what music I'm working on, or updates on a project I'm starting. All while remaining relatively anonymous?

On that note, if I sent you this URL, and you're reading this right now knowing full well who the one typing is, then you're either really cool or you're a college admissions officer. Not saying that college admissions officers aren't cool..

Anyway, enjoy the site I guess. Ha det.
