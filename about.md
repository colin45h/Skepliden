Skepliden for me is just somewhere to post kind of whatever I want when I want. I'd rather post things here than put them on places like Twitter or Instagram. Those sites are so filled with people so focused on getting likes and making clever captions; like why does it matter?

Skepliden is a place to get away from all of that. A place where I can post what's going on in my head, what music I'm working on, or updates on a project I'm starting. All while remaining kinda sorta anonymous?

On that note, if I sent you this URL, and you're reading this right now knowing full well who the one typing is, then you're either really cool or you're some sort of recruiter. Not saying that recruiters aren't cool.. :D

Enjoy!
