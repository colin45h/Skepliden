#### (10/24/22) Copy-pasting what I found on my Macbook's Notes earlier today, again. This one kind of speaks for itself.

And this one's reallyout there, but once again, this is raw. I'm kind of afraid of the fact that this is going to be publicly accessible, though idk another part of me wants to be as transparent as humanly possible. Here it is:

Something I need to know

I enjoy being around people who have minds I don’t understand. People that are “deep” I guess. And a part of that could be just the intelligence of the person, but the other part is knowing that they have something else going on behind the scenes of what you see when you’re with them. Even some people that seem like they’re bare and opener really bare and open for a reason as well. People that are emotionally or mentally naked have a reason for doing so.

I categorize people and my family knows about it. That much is obvious, but I think the categorizing goes a little deeper than subgroups of humans, these people are stupid, these people are frat boys, these people are pretentious, these people are ____ you get the point… I categorize people at a much larger scale, and I think this is 

I have to get drunk or high just to REALLY ENJOY myself with these people???? THATS INSANE. I have to make myself stop thinking the way I normally do, or make myself fucking STUPID just to REALLY enjoy the time I’m spending in the room. I guess this is the reason why I’m so picky with people. And the sad part of it I can’t understand if it’s my problem, if it’s some personal issue I’m grasping to deal with, or if the world really is just 85% depressing. The 85% being the average human you can interact with. WHY AREN’T ALL PEOPLE BY NATURE GOOD PEOPLE OR AT LEAST INTERESTING PEOPLE. WHY DO YOU GET TO BREATH IF YOU’RE SO AVERAGE LIKE THAT. WHAT A CLICHE YOU LIVE IN. NOT EVEN A MOVIE CLICHE BUT A WHOLE PATTERN THAT ALL HUMAN LIVES CONFORM TO. Hypocritical of me to say. Probably. It all came out I guess. Didn’t even know I was thinking this way. sorry. 

They only want to help themselves. They amount to nothing. They continue their disgusting and corrupt bloodline. All to make things more difficult for the people that are working so damn hard to make the world a better place even just with kindness or with creation.

This being said, I’m enjoying life right now. Life is actually pretty good and I have a really good rhythm. I’m enjoying my time in Iowa and the beauty that there is here. the “skill gap” in students still does frustrate me sometimes. But I’m breaking out of my god complex, or so I thought before writing this. The human nature of comparison was drowning me, and there’s a lot more to enjoy in building myself than worrying about a concrete wall separating me and the so called average or stupid human being. The Harvard university gates for the most part.

We’ll keep working I guess, the only way ill get to see the things I want to, be with the people I want to, and create the things I want to create are by moving forward. with future sight there’s a lot of time I can fill with the good people I’ve found the good places Ive found and the goals I’ve set my sights on. We move.



Make a post of all these thoughts —> I’m not a writer or an artist, but if I was, this is what my sketchbook would look like. Here’s not what I’m thinking emotionally, but consciously/logically when I’m alone and have the time and headspace. Lack of mental luggage.
