#### Just wanted to talk about some things I'm working on. (07-28-20) 

I'm writing this for two reasons; One, that by getting everything I'm working on down on paper I'll be able to lead a more organized life so to speak, and Two, that by getting these things down I'll commit to them more. If I wrote it for myself and others to see, I have to get it done. So let's get started.

### Number 1

I've already wrote about the new _Skepliden._ moniker on Instagram, Apple Music, Spotify, and such so I feel it's right to "announce" that I'm beginning work on an EP. I mean, I'm still only getting like 6 monthly listeners but I think with each song and beat that I release I get better at producing the music that I actually want to make. At the moment, I don't really care what genre I make (even though it's mostly been chill type stuff). This EP is probably going to be a more downbeat one, something super chill that you can listen to _in your feels_ or on a night drive. Hopefully something really meaningful and ambient that makes others and I actually want to listen to it. That's the move. I've got some new instruments and techniques I want to try out, as well as some samples that I found just recently, so I think I have all the tools I need to get going with this thing. It's probably going to be around 4-5 songs or so? Probably with an intro and/or interlude somewhere in there. We'll see, I haven't figured out all the details yet.

### Number 2

The software internship stuff has been going on all summer, though the last two or so weeks have been sort of unproductive. This afternoon I had a call with my boss that got my interest back into programming. I had been focusing too much on music, my part time jobs, and hanging out with people that I had not set aside any time for programming at all. Well, there was time available, but I decided to spend it watching shows and playing videogames. Now that I got my next assignment, I'm back in this thing. The Contact Manager application that I'm developing is falling a little flat in terms of some of the functionality I designed when initially made it, on top of user accessibility and aesthetic. So for the next couple days or so, I'm going to work on that as well as fixing my User system. The process I use to let users log in is really slow and insecure, so I'm working on a new method to do it that fixes that. That's number one, then I'll move on to the older fixes and aesthetic. This isn't really a new project that I'm announcing or anything, it's more of just me getting this down for motivation. 

### Number 3

Probably the most pointless of the three, but I'm hoping to get to Gold rank in League of Legends. Yeah, I know, not really that important of a goal and stuff, but I spend a lot of time playing video games, so I figure I should at least try to get something out of them. A gold rank would mean that I'm a somewhat decent player, and of course I still want to climb higher after that, but being gold is a good start. 

### Conclusion

I'm trying to think of some other things that I'm working on right now, but the only thing I can think of is working on my home and music setup. I need to make a list of everything I want to buy and start actually saving up for this stuff. That way I can make my way towards the setup I've always wanted, a bass guitar, and the ability to make better music exist. I don't think that belongs in the _numbered projects_ section though, so I'll just use it as a filler to make this conclusion look half decent. OH, and one more thing, I need official branding for __Skepliden.__ so I'm probably gonna do some "photoshoots" in the next couple days. Nothing fancy of course haha, and I'm not the biggest fan of taking pictures of myself, but I need something official and I don't feel like paying someone to make a logo or developing something like that, so some cool-ish pictures of myself will have to do. Anyway, it's 3 am and I should probably go to bed. Good night squad.
