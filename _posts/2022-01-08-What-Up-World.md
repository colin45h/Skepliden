#### (1/8/22) For some reason, we back. Here's an update.

Hey all! I don't know how many "It's been a while," posts we're going to get on here, but here's another one.

I'm a college student at The University of Iowa now, WHOO! I have a research job and a whole lot of extracurricular involvement, and my grades are pretty solid as well. BUT THIS ISN'T A PAT ON THE BACK. I have an interview at **Google** next Tuesday, and holy SHIT am I nervous. Excusez mon fran√ßais.

I'm noticing a reoccuring theme of my difficulty with free time, and this time it's taking a different form. I'm getting things done, way more than I used to on my own time, to be fair; Though I know I can do **SO MUCH MORE.** I'm still cracking the code on this whole sleep schedule thing. When you have classes or a job to go to, it's pretty easy, you just wake up, or you get bad grades and/or get fired.

Now, in a sense (and like I've always have), I'm working for myself. The Leetcode or HackerRank work I do for these interviews? The development of this social safety platform for my startup? The reading of a book I BOUGHT to understand Deep Learning? All up to me. So logically, it's quite a simple concept. WORK, or nothing gets done, and I make no progress.

I just went through an issue with a longtime friend of mine that cost me 6 days of sleep and level-headed thinking. Now I finally have the headspace to work and build myself again. The one, **BIG,** roadblock in my way however, is my sleep schedule. It's 3:37am right now. Now 3:38. I'm going to be trying a few new strategies to hopefully make sleep a calming and necessary process in my brain over the next few days. I don't want to dread sleeping anymore purely because I can't get my ass out of bed. THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THAT BEHAVIOR. Lot's of capital letters being used on this fine evening/morning.

If you're reading this and your name isn't Colin Hehn, what's up? How's your day going? I'm genuinely surprised you're here. I'm now debating if a part of me is hoping a recruiter is reading this, thinking: *"Wow! What a cool way to get yourself motivated, this guy is so inspiring, let's hire him!"* That is 100% undoubtedly the reason I write this stuff. NOT!

Anyway, whoever you are, wherever your head is at right now, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, but that light only gets brighter with each step you take forward. Do something for yourself today, and I don't mean that *mental health day, you deserve this, go you!* BS, I mean do something outstandingly productive your future self will thank you for. Mental health is important, but the abundance of those messages nowadays drives me nuts. Those days are only needed when you're getting burnt out from working so damn hard in the first place.

LET'S GET AFTER IT! 

Take care,
Colin
