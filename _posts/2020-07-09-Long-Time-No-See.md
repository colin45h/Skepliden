#### (7/09/20) Hey, I'm back. It's been a minute.

This writing comes after a few friends told me I should get more out on this site, which yes, implies the fact that I've shared this thing with a few more people. Honestly, it's pretty out there at this point. Let me tell you what's going on; The state of this site (or brand, I should say now), and what's up with me..

### Intro

To start, _skepliden_ is starting to get out as a public moniker rather than a site or private affair. The reason for this was some reason inspiration to dive into the Lo-Fi music genre. Instead of just posting guitar covers on this site (in the future, on Instagram and Twitter), I started making some Lo-Fi "songs," or beats really, and found myself needing a name to post under. Considering this name has some actual meaning, I figured I would use it for whatever music I decide to put out. Right now I'm just making some chill // Lo-Fi type stuff, but I know in the future I'm going to want making some legit __music__. It's just that right now, with just a few instruments and pieces of recording equipment on top of a tight schedule, slapping a few piano chords down and making a beat is really time efficient, and sounds pretty damn good for a beat made within a day or two. So, until further notice, __Skepliden.__ is the moniker // brand name I'm going to be shoving everything under. Whether it be a guitar cover on a lake or a future bass track, it's gonna be used. Now, with that sorta out of the way, let me show you everything in stock, including the two songs I've already released.

### The Skepliden. Brand

Ok, first with the links. I'm going to do this using Markdown to make everything look a little cooler. As far as _music sites_ go, I'm currently on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/skepliden), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/43OrpaXYSmTqAC7mvPMKPO?si=jE_yj83bTS2pnZSLffpHXQ), and [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/skepliden/1522111519). While you can find my music on a LOT of other platforms as well, these are definitely the main ones. In terms of _social media_, I have a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/skepliden), and an [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/skepliden/). I have yet to use either of these under this name, but I'm 1000% sure that they are going to get used in the future, whether it be for exposure (idk maybe), or posting something cool like a guitar cover (yes yes yes).

Now, instead of having to click a link in order to listen to my two new "songs," there's a way I can just throw them into this site like this:

There we go. Listen if you want, they're nothing special, but I think they're pretty good for my first and second try..

### Some Final Thoughts

With the _official_ stuff out of the way, I think this is a good spot to just write down what I'm doing right now. A surprising amount has changed since my last post, and while I'm partly trying to get this out there, most of the reason I'm writing this last part is sort of as a checklist for myself. So I can ask myself, "Hey, what did I do this summer?" and have a half decent answer. Well, Mr. Seaver hooked me up with an internship at a software company last spring, and ever since June I've been doing a lot of programming and learning a bunch of new technologies. It's kinda weird, being a full time nerd, and not even going to an office or anything; because of quarantine, we've been doing everything remotely. Which, so far has been fine but I'm now starting to realize the immense amount of help an in-person interaction would've been for a few of these projects. As of now, I've worked with C#, SQL, The Microsoft Azure Platform, JSON, and I'm just now starting to do work with REST API's. A lot of foreign language if you're not a computer nerd like I am, but honestly, I just needed to list the stuff I've done so far, to keep track of everything. 

Anyway, beyond the internship, which I pretty much do work for on my own time (some weeks a LOT of work, some weeks very little), I got a job hosting at the Red Robin near me. A few friends of mine have been working there for a while, so I thought I'd join in. Everything there has been awesome so far, and I can say I'm enjoying the job so far; Then again I've only been there two and a half weeks, so I guess we'll see how much fun it is after a few months. 

I've stuck with That's Amore for the time being, so I'm still a pizza cashier, dishwasher, prep cook, cleaner flex player thing, just working a few shifts every week and whenever they need an extra guy on deck. I can definitely say I'm not in it for the money; I could pick up more shifts at Red Robin or go work another job in place of That's Amore and make a hell of a lot more dough. Considering a lot of the workers are seniors going off to a college, they are losing a lot of the core workforce that they've had for so long, so I want to stick around until at least get some more. I'm even getting my sister a job there, so I can sorta pass on the torch.

Yeah, so in conclusion, my summer has been a lot of __code__, __work__, and __stay up until 6 am with the homies__. Most of my days, I wake up between 12-2 pm, go to work, and from there go to a friends house for the night; if not, then I'm on my computer writing some new functions or playing Mortal Kombat until whenever I get tired. Not a terrible way to spend the summer, working hard, playing harder. When I started writing this post I was kinda stressed out, about a software project I'm working on, and something happening next week, on top of juggling all of these things and remaining happy. Now that I'm pretty much done, I feel a bit better. Crazy how writing down thoughts and stuff clears your mind. Looking back, I think I just needed a reminder to enjoy the ride. That's an important part of life that I think a lot of people forget about, including me. Sure, you have all these goals to meet, aspirations to fulfill, and work to get done, but if you're not enjoying it in the long run, what's the point? Anyway, I'm out for the night. It's 2:40 AM and I think my sleep schedule needs some help. Enjoy the ride, squad.
