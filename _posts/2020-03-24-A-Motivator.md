#### (3/24/20) An excuse? COVID-19 and it's effects on my productivity.

Not an excuse, but something getting in my way. 

You would think that with how much stress it was to find time to work on side projects during school, having all this free time would be the best thing ever. I have all this time to make and develop shit and yet I can't get out of bed before one o'clock. Surprisingly frustrating, having all this free time.

So I guess this is an apology to myself, and a self motivator. It's time to turn this next week into a little bit of productivity. 

I'm going to write, learn, make, or develop, something. This is that update I talked about in that last post. __Something is going to get done, hopefully for real this time.__

I'll be posting *something* about my endeavors in the near future.

Ser deg senere !
