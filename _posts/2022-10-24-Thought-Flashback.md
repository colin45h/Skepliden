#### (10/24/22) Copy-pasting what I found on my Macbook's Notes earlier today. With my current state of mind, checking this stuff out has helped at least a little.

This fall has been difficult for me, for a culmination of many reasons, though here's something I wrote back in May, when I had things together a little more, I think... I fear this shows what an ego I have to work on, but it's raw, and I don't believe altering it helps anyone. And honestly, this is **nothing** compared to what's coming in the next one. :/

Moral high ground

#### May 6th, 2022
I’m Swiss. I’ve grown up in the middle of everything, and for a while, predominantly in middle school and high school, my personality and behavior changed with the wind. And to some extent, I do still act differently when I’ve been in one place too long, as I’m sure anyone would.

That being said, I’ve steadied out. I grew up with the rich kids, the adrenaline junkies, the horrendously intelligent, the clinically depressed, the savers-shoe wearers, the unwavering religious, and beyond. I never quite fit into a singular category, which awarded me this sort of outside looking-in perspective on the ways of life of many, including my own. As someone with the points of view of the frat boy, scholarship dependent, and bus-boy, I believe it’s within my right and duty to find solutions that work for all with an inherent lack of bias. We’ll grade based on character, not wealth, skin color, or social status. I don’t give a damn who you are, as long as you help the man who has fallen, the mistress in need of protection, forgive me if the 19th century is engrained in that last part, though it is a fact that the man’s body is better suited to uphold justice than it’s counterpart, especially when the perpetrator of an evil mimics the stature of the hero. Those who gain the respect of those we deem peers on this planet will amount to something, that something being honest, true to themselves, and for the betterment of them and those around them. 

I have some of my most introspective thoughts on Saturdays, for some odd reason. If I’m in a weird mood on a Saturday, or I don’t want to do anything, this might be why. Saturday, weirdly enough, is a thinking day for me. When the work week is “over,” I can stop and think about the big questions in life, and when those big questions are involved, I gain a sort of state of psychosis (not literally). 

<br>

Now here I am in the fall of 2022, just a few months laters from writing this. I think this view of mine still holds up, though I was naive to think I possessed a lack of bias. My upbringing presents biases all the same as anyone else’s, though part of me still believes that it may be to a lesser extent.

This fall I haven’t felt as, maybe, “pure” as I once was. I don’t know if it’s just my psyche, the environment I’m living in, and/or the people I’m surrounded by, but I would have to guess that notion couldn’t be too far off.

I have been in one of the biggest slumps of my life, as a person, overall. And thus, I want to get out of this.
I want to be:
- A better friend.
- A smarter, more driven, individual.
- A Saturday thinker.
- A better person.

So here’s to making that happen. Let’s get it done.

All of this can be done just by changing my ways, no money involved, no relying on people for things, etc. This is all intrinsic, I just need to put in the work. Let’s do it.
