#### (2/18/20) Laying out what to expect on this site, what I plan to do with it, post on it, etc. My first post, and really nothing that interesting. Feel free to skip this one.

Okay, so I finally got this thing set up, and now it's just a matter of figuring out what to write about and post. I'm kind of new to this whole thing, considering I've never kept a daily journal, and the fact that I literally just forked this web layout from someone much more comfortable with the Jekyll API and such. In the future I plan to make something a little more true to me and/or something that fits what I'm going to post a little bit better.

I'm honestly looking back at this and cringing.. Whenever I write essays and articles for the school everything usually flows and sounds filled with voice and clever and good and why is this not like that? Now thinking about it, a _blog_ (hate that word) is really just a HUGE reflection of voice. That's pretty much all it is, which could actually make this more challenging than I thought. However, with time I think things could all work out, as I'll get used to this way of writing and maybe learn how _markdown_ works. I mean, I have some of it on lock down, like bolding, italicizing, and a few other things.

	Look at this thing ! Kinda cool right ?
    
But how the hell do you indent a paragraph!? It really shouldn't be that hard, but I can't seem to figure out the way to do it with this formatting. Markdown is cool, but my knowledge of it really reflects what work I have to do on this site, on top of the content I'm going to post on it. Speaking of which, as my first post it would only be fair to address what I plan to do with the site going forward, from content to interface updates. Allow me to flex the formatting I _do_ know:  

#### Content / Posting

- Music (Audio + Video Form, Me playing guitar, A new trap beat I made for a friend, or something I'm seriously producing. Really just whatever music is in my head, whether it be mine or not.)
- Writing (Maybe there's something I really want to write an analysis of or something in the world that I need to give my own take on, sounds really weird but you'll get it sooner or later.)
- Thoughts (What's happening at school, in my head, or something I'm really thinking hard about. Did I just discover some pattern about highschoolers and mental health? Okay, let's write something about it. Maybe someone else is feeling the same way.. This and writing are pretty damn similar, but ignore that.)
- I have yet to link my YouTube or account of that sort to this website (For music related things or other videos I want to post, I'm going to need to configure my accounts like Soundcloud, Spotify, and YouTube to work with this site.)

### Website Design / Dev

- Get my own domain and maybe hosting, on my own server or a cloud platform (miv0x.github.io isn't going to cut it man.. I'm hoping for Skepliden.io but we'll see.)
- Categorize posts for easy searching (I'm going to want to look at my writing on a NASA discovery one day and my writing on how terrible work went another.)
- A Tab for all my music related things (videos, tabs, songs, covers, whatever man.)
- A website of my own (This one __IS__ my own, but I'm talking about something I didn't completely rip off of someone on the most popular Jekyll theme site..)

Why am I putting all this effort into a site that I don't really want anyone to see? Well, it could be to keep my sanity. My little online journal that exists for everyone. Another reason could be that a college admissions officer might like it, that it gives them a pretty good look into what kind of dude I am. Whatever the reason, and whoever is reading, whether it's me in 10 years or a friend reading this 10 days from now, I'm hoping to keep this thing going. I'm hoping to stick with it, write some stuff, record some stuff, and stay classy.

If you're reading this, wow, you're here early. Or you scrolled to the bottom of my posts? Either way, I'm glad you're here, and thanks for sticking around.

Ha det !
