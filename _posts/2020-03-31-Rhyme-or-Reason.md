#### (3/31/20) A prelude to a few ideas coming soon, a perspective on the future, and an ode to the bullshit that goes on in our brains. 

Hei everyone, I'm back with something.

#### 03/01/20

It would be a lie to say that this past week has gone really well. As a matter of fact, while there were quite a few high moments, most of them I found were plagued with an anxiety. One about the future, people around me, and love. A few pretty important tests got me thinking this way, so I figured writing about it couldn't hurt. Every kid my age is worrying about what the future holds; A radical assumption, yes, but I wholeheartedly believe it to be true in most, if not all cases.

I continue writing this piece a few weeks later, most of which I've been _stuck_ inside doing nothing but sleeping in until 2:00 and playing videogames. A week ago I promised I would get something done, and I think we're actually making some leaps and bounds here. My methodology is a little scattered, but here's what I've been up to:

- We've got a domain! Finally no more _miv0x.github.io_, rather we have _skepliden.net_, making this site thing a little more official. It took me no more than half an hour this morning to get it all setup, and some cash out of my pocket, but that's irrelevant. Working on getting a favicon as we speak; I'm getting tired of looking at that weird piece of paper on the tab.
- I've begun work on an essay about willpower. I've struggled with that over the course of being locked indoors for two weeks, so I figured knowing how to use it to my advantage could only help me get a little more productive during quarantine; an essay seems to be a decent way of going about that. Though as of now I'm not even sure if I should call it an essay, an editorial, an article, or whatever. __What I'm saying is there's a lot of work to do.__
- The musical process has been slow, but I think I've finally found the path towards making an official video and cover. I've got the song. It's on the easier side, offering a good introduction for me to get something of quality out there. Even then however, I would like to go beyond just making covers of easily played songs, because where's the talent in that? I keep beating myself up over that sort of thing and I'm stuck wondering if I should drop it or use it to fuel something more difficult and skill intensive. I'm not sure, so starting with this cover is the way to go; I'll figure everything else out afterwards.

Looking back at the start of this draft, I could see why I wanted to start writing when I felt that way. Part of me is actually disappointed that the feeling went away. Over these last couple of weeks, I haven't focused on any problems of the sort. No important tests left me thinking I could've done better, nor did I talk with any friends about important issues and life goals.

Even still, I get this feeling that I'm not doing enough (which is fair considering I haven't left my house other than to work) in a few different aspects of my life, but I may just be holding myself up to too high a standard. That's one quality I'm incredibly grateful for that also upsets me beyond words.

On a side note, I never realized how cringy this website thing would turn out. Writing to no one is a lot harder than it seems, whereas writing for school feels much more structured and less awkward. There have been times where I sit here in front of my screen for 15 minutes before figuring out the right way to say _hello_. Crazy man. Speaking of which, I'm out of here. Not sure what's coming next; It could be a SoundCloud cover, an update, or a whole ass essay. Either way, I'll see you then.
