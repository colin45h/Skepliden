#### I finally got something! Featuring a draft cover dedicated to figuring out the process of how to get my guitar out there.

The wait was long guys but we did it. This was something I did in one take just to test the setup and the quality of the audio. I know it's rough, but I really just wanted to get something up on this site. I promise there's more to come.. Update soon !
